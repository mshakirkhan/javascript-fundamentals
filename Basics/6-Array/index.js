// Defination: An array is a data structure that is used to represent the list of items.

// Important Point: 
// 1. As we know javascript is a dynamic language / type so we are able to change the array value type on runtime.
// 2. In JavaScript array is an object.

// Example

let phoneBrands = ['Apple', 'Samsung', 'Realme'];
phoneBrands[3] = 27;

console.log(phoneBrands);
